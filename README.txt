This project presents the background and concepts underlying QCA, as a potential alternative to
CMOS technologies in computation. Various conventional logic gates were simulated, showing that
QCA can perform any Boolean operation.
Additionally, two reversible logic gates, and a reversible full-adder circuit were simulated, as
reversible computing in QCA would represent close to the ideal in computing.

Uses QCADesigner to simulate circuits.
